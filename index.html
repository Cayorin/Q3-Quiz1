					<p>During the early 1900's, when Hitler was just 18, he moved from Austria, Linz to Austria, Vienna. During his stay in Vienna, he realized he wanted to be an artist</p>

					<p>When he was in Vienna, he worked as both a casual labor and an artist. In his early months in Vienna, he slept, sketched and read piles of books even making one of his on later on.</p>

					<p>Everything would change after his application to Vienna Academy of Fine Arts, during 1907, in where he was very convinced he would pass. However he failed as, although he passed the exam, his drawing skills were "unsatisfactory"</p>

					<p>He tried again the following year but failed. He made a living off selling water color paintings to tourists and frame-sellers and would continue selling paintings until 1914.</p>
